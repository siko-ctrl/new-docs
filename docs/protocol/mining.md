# Mining and Emissions

## Mining Overview

Salvium uses a proof-of-work (PoW) mining algorithm designed to be ASIC-resistant while maintaining network security and decentralization.

## Mining Algorithm

### RandomX
- CPU-optimized
- Memory-hard
- ASIC-resistant
- Regular updates

### Specifications
- Block time: 120 seconds
- Memory requirement: 2GB
- Verification time: <1ms
- Difficulty adjustment: Every block

## Emission Schedule

### Initial Supply
- Genesis block: 0 SAL
- Pre-mine: None
- Fair launch
- Community-driven

### Emission Rate
```
Block Reward = Base Reward × Emission Speed Factor
```

### Schedule
1. **Years 1-2**
   - Higher emission rate
   - Community distribution
   - Network bootstrapping
   - Ecosystem development

2. **Years 3-5**
   - Moderate emission
   - Network stability
   - Balanced distribution
   - Market maturity

3. **Years 6+**
   - Tail emission
   - Long-term sustainability
   - Network security
   - Inflation control
