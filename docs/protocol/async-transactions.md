# Asynchronous Transactions (AT)

## Overview

Asynchronous Transactions (AT) are a unique feature of the Salvium protocol that allows for non-instantaneous transaction processing. This mechanism enhances privacy and enables advanced financial operations within the network.

## How AT Works

### Basic Concept
- Transaction initiation
- Time delay mechanism
- Verification process
- Final settlement

### Components
1. Time Lock
2. Verification Layer
3. Settlement Engine
4. Privacy Enhancement

## Use Cases

### 1. Enhanced Privacy
- Transaction mixing
- Temporal obfuscation
- Pattern prevention
- Identity protection

### 2. Financial Operations
- Scheduled payments
- Time-locked contracts
- Conditional transfers
- Automated operations

### 3. Security Features
- Double-spend prevention
- Attack mitigation
- Network protection
- Transaction validation

## Implementation

### Technical Details
- Block structure
- Transaction format
- Verification process
- Settlement rules

### Network Rules
- Minimum delay
- Maximum delay
- Fee structure
- Validation requirements

## Benefits

### Privacy Enhancement
- Transaction unlinking
- Temporal privacy
- Pattern obfuscation
- Identity protection

### Network Security
- Attack resistance
- Spam prevention

## Technical Specifications

### Transaction Format
```json
{
  "type": "AT",
  "delay": "time_units",
  "conditions": [],
  "payload": {}
}
```

### Verification Process
1. Initial validation
2. Time-lock check
3. Condition verification
4. Settlement process
