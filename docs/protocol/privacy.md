# About Privacy in Salvium

## Overview

Privacy is a fundamental feature of Salvium, implemented through a combination of cryptographic techniques and protocol-level mechanisms. This document explains how Salvium protects user privacy while maintaining regulatory compliance.

## Core Privacy Features

### 1. Ring Signatures
- Transaction obfuscation
- Sender anonymity
- Group signing
- Plausible deniability

### 2. Stealth Addresses
- One-time addresses
- Address unlinkability
- Payment privacy
- Recipient protection

### 3. Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT)
- Amount privacy
- Transaction confidentiality
- Balance verification
- Zero-knowledge proofs

## Implementation Details

### Ring Signatures
```
Ring Size: 11 (default)
Signature Type: MLSAG
Key Images: Unique identifiers
Decoy Selection: Deterministic
```

### Stealth Addresses
```
Format: 95-character string
Prefix: "Sal"
Integrated Addresses: Optional payment ID
Subaddresses: Multiple receiving addresses
```

### RingCT
```
Protocol: Bulletproofs
Range Proofs: Zero-knowledge
Amount Encoding: Pedersen Commitments
Verification: Efficient batch processing
```
