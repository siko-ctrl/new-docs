# Calculating Current Yield

## Overview

This guide explains how yield is calculated in the Salvium network, including staking rewards, transaction fees, and other yield-generating mechanisms.

## Yield Components

### 1. Staking Rewards
- Base staking rate
- Lock-up period multipliers
- Network participation bonus
- Time-weighted rewards

### 2. Transaction Fees
- Network usage fees
- Priority fees
- Smart contract fees
- Special transaction fees

### 3. Network Incentives
- Node operation rewards
- Validator rewards
- Community contributions
- Development incentives

## Calculation Formula

### Base Yield
```
Base Yield = Stake Amount × Base Rate × Time Period
```

### Adjusted Yield
```
Adjusted Yield = Base Yield × (1 + Lock-up Multiplier) × Network Multiplier
```

### Total Yield
```
Total Yield = Adjusted Yield + Transaction Fees + Network Incentives
```

## Factors Affecting Yield

### Network Parameters
- Total staked amount
- Network activity
- Transaction volume
- Node count

### Time Factors
- Lock-up duration
- Staking period
- Network age
- Block time

### User Factors
- Stake amount
- Lock-up choice
- Node operation
- Network participation

## Yield Optimization
